## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>
Welcome to this freedom of music. This is where you will have your best time in 2024.

## <a id="agile-methodology">Agile Methodology</a>
This project is managed using Agile principles tailored for a solo developer, focusing on iterative development and continuous improvement. I utilize a flexible approach to project management that allows for adapting to changes and refining features based on ongoing evaluation and feedback. To help manage tasks and progress, I employ a Kanban board. The link to the board can be found [Here](https://github.com/users/JorgenDIF/projects/4). It provides a visual overview of ongoing, upcoming, and completed work, ensuring that I stay organized and focused on the most critical tasks at hand. This personal agility ensures that the development process remains aligned with the evolving project goals and my learning objectives.
